![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bfcd9cc-0f52-4821-9fa3-7fb1b2daf861)

## üìã Refactoring Plan

### 1. Code Structure & Naming Conventions
- Rename component to `TodoApp` instead of default export
- Use consistent camelCase naming (e.g., `setTodos` instead of `settodos`)
- Add proper type annotations (TypeScript) or PropTypes
- Split into smaller components (TodoItem, TodoForm, TodoList)

### 2. State Management
- Consider using a reducer pattern for complex state changes
- Move state logic to custom hooks for reusability
- Add proper error handling for user inputs

### 3. Performance Improvements
- Add memoization for list items to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement batch updates for multiple state changes

### 4. Code Duplication
- Create a unified function for tasks that follow similar patterns (uppercase, mark as done)
- Extract repeated styling logic to separate constants or CSS classes

### 5. Accessibility & UX
- Add proper ARIA attributes for accessibility 
- Implement keyboard navigation support
- Add focus states and improve button labeling

### 6. Testing
- Add unit tests for components and functions
- Implement integration tests for user workflows
